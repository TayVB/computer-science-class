Today i picked UX design to research. Seeing that the more we advance with tech as a population more power is being given to the user, therefor making this a growing industry. This all meaning those producers are constantly puting out more prototypes for people to experiment and test on the public. these prototypes can consume of many different skills depending on the subject they are testing, but most all of them are aimed at human emotions. for one these prototypes have to be relatable enough for the users to interract and secondly the app/website questions must on topic and common enough for all user conceptions.
